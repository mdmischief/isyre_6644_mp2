## Prerequesites

Requires Python ">=3.7.1,<3.10"

Execution requires the following PYthon packages be installed:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* scipy
* statistics
* argparse
* pathlib

Optionally, you may use the included Poetry Environment Files:

* poetry.lock
* pyproject.toml

## Contents

* README.MD - This file.
* mp1.py - Simulation script written in Python

    ```Python
    usage: mp1.py [-h] [-ns N_STUDENTS] [-w WEEKEND_CHECK] [-eps EPISODES] [-nd N_DAYS] [-p P] [-ndi N_DAYS_INFECTIOUS]

    ISYE 6644 MiniProject1 - Flu.

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -ns N_STUDENTS, --n_students N_STUDENTS
                            Number of Students
    -w WEEKEND_CHECK, --weekend_check WEEKEND_CHECK
                            Account for no school on Weekends
    -eps EPISODES, --episodes EPISODES
                            Number of episodes to simulate
    -nd N_DAYS, --n_days N_DAYS
                            Number of days to simulate
    -p P, --probability_infect P
                            Probabilty of Infection
    -ndi N_DAYS_INFECTIOUS, --n_days_infectious N_DAYS_INFECTIOUS
                            Number of days infectious
    ```

    Example with default parameters:

    ```Python
    python mp1.py
    ```

    Example with modified parameters:

    ```Python
    python mp1.py -ns 30 -p 0.10 -w False -ndi 5 -eps 100000
    ```

* Figures Directory - Contains all figures for the default simulation parameters, with runs that do/do not have a weekend break, for 10^3..10^6 runs.
  * Flu_Pandemic_Fig_1 - Histogram of Pandemic Length (Simulated)
  * Flu_Pandemic_Fig_1_smallbins - Histogram of Pandemic Length with increased number of bins (Simulated)
  * Flu_Pandemic_Fig_2 - Histogram of First Two Days of Pandemic (Theorectical)
  * Flu_Pandemic_Fig_2 - Histogram of First Two Days of Pandemic (Empirical)
  * Flu_Pandemic_means - Line Chart of Cumulative number of Mean Infections

* Tables Directory - csv files generated from the Python script that were used to create Table 1 and Table 2 in the report.
  * day2_dist.csv - The theoretical distribution of kids infected by day 2 (Table 1)
  * p_range.csv - Percent of episodes that ended in all kids infected for simulations at differnet infection rates, p. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of 1000 episodes each. (Table 2)

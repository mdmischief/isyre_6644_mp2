# Programming-Oriented Problems

Pandemic Flu Spread.One of the choices for Mini-Project 1 was a(trivial) simulation of pandemic flu spread in a classroom. For Mini-Project 2, I’d like you to think about a bigger-and-better simulation involving a larger population.Here’s a potential scenario (there are many other interesting ones — feel free to be imaginative):

* Some infectious people enter a population of susceptibles, and some of the susceptibles become infected.
* There is a short period of a couple of days before a newly-infected person inturn becomes infectious.
* When a person recovers (or dies), the person is not again susceptible.
* Infectiousness or death can be mitigated by masking, social distancing, etc.
* Infectiousness or death can be mitigated by vaccination. Vaccines can be delivered in one or two doses. But there could be supply chain issues.
* Even if a vaccine requires two doses, the vaccine nevertheless provides partial immunization after even only one dose. Might you immediately give everyone only one dose instead of two, and hope that the supply chain catches up so that you can “eventually” give everyone two doses?

To determine whether a particular strategy is any good, you probably ought to consider the number of people who eventually get infected (or die), the length of the epidemic, etc.
